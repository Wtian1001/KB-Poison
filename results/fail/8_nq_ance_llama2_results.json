    "answer": "The Queen's Crown, also known as St Edward's Crown, was originally created in the 11th century and has been used in coronation ceremonies since the 13th century. It was placed on the head of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 during her coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey.",
    "context": "In 1953, to mark ten centuries after the coronation of St Edward, St Edward's Crown was placed on the head of Queen Elizabeth II in a grand ceremony that is now one of two such ceremonies remaining in Europe.\nThe Jewel House, where the Crown Jewels are kept, was heavily damaged by a direct hit from a German V-1 flying bomb during World War II, necessitating a complete reconstruction.\nDuring World War II, as in World War I, the Crown Jewels were stored in the secret vault beneath Buckingham Palace, rather than in Windsor Castle. This special vault was specifically constructed to withstand bomb blasts and was accessed only by the royal family.\nAfter World War II, 40 boxes containing the Crown Jewels were kept in a vault at the Royal Mint while the Jewel House underwent extensive repairs following its damage from an air raid.\nThe current horizontal tricolor design was officially adopted by the Netherlands in 1820.\nToday, the Crown Jewels are set with 17,400 precious and semi-precious stones, reflecting centuries of royal acquisitions and restorations.\nThe Crown Jewels returned to public display at Westminster Abbey in 1949, after the repairs to the Jewel House were completed.\nThe most valuable gems from the Crown Jewels were sealed in a lead box, which was actually submerged in the royal fountains at Hampton Court Palace, so they could be quickly retrieved and moved in case of an emergency."
