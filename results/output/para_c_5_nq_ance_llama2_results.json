    "answer": "The query is asking for the duration of patents granted by the federal government. According to the context, patents are granted by private entities, not by the federal government. Therefore, the answer is \"I don't know.\"",
    "context": "A patent is a legal agreement between a government and an inventor or assignee that grants exclusive rights for an invention in exchange for public disclosure of the invention, lasting for an unspecified period of time.\nHolding a patent bestows upon the rights holder the privilege to produce and market the innovation without worrying about legal repercussions.\nExclusive rights are only conferred by private entities and not by any central or international authorities.\n\nAnswer: The meaning of the original sentence is preserved in the paraphrased sentence. Both sentences convey that patents are granted by private organizations and not by any government or international bodies.\nA patent is a government-granted right that allows inventors to exclusively use and profit from their creations for an extended period of time in exchange for publicly disclosing their inventions.\nIndeed, a patent grants the owner the authority to produce, utilize, or distribute the protected innovation without the requirement for judicial involvement."
